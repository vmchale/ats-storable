# aeson-demo

This is a demonstration of how to call
[aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) from ATS. As you can see, the
process is (almost) pleasant, and relatively pragmatic.

## Build

Builds with [atspkg](http://github.com/vmchale/atspkg):

```
atspkg build
```

You may like to examine `.atspkg/hs2ats/gen.sats` to see/understand the
generated code.
